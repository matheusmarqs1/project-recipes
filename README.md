# Recipes Project
Welcome to the Recipes Project! This is a simple static website that showcases a collection of recipes. It was my first project, and my main goal was to experiment with web development concepts, focus on building a functional site, and improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This static website displays a list of recipes, including key information like ingredients, preparation steps, and images. As my first project, I focused primarily on ensuring everything was functional, while experimenting with layout techniques and styling.

## 🎯 Features
- Recipe List: Display of several recipes with images, ingredients, and steps.
- Simple Layout: A minimalistic and clean design that highlights the recipe content.
- Static Pages: All pages are pre-built and content is hardcoded for a simple and quick display.
- Basic Styling: The design is simple, focusing on providing clear information in an organized way.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the content of the website.
- CSS: For styling and layout.

## ⚙️ What I Learned
- HTML and CSS Fundamentals: This was my first major project, and I learned the basics of HTML and CSS while building it.
- Design and Structure: I learned how to structure a clean and user-friendly layout, making sure it’s easy for users to navigate and read.

## 🛠️ What Could Be Improved
- Interactivity: Adding JavaScript to make the website dynamic and interactive could be a good next step.
- Responsive Design: To make the site more mobile-friendly, I could add media queries and use more advanced layout techniques.
- Design Improvements: Future improvements can include using CSS Flexbox or Grid Layout for a more structured, flexible layout.
